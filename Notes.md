## Navigate R Studio and Setup Project

    * Select "Version Control" -> "Git"
      * Repository URL: your "https" repository value (see instructions above)
      * Project directory name: leave blank
      * Create project as a subdirectory of: ~/work (click "Browse" to change)
      * Click "Create Project"

      * Verify that you are in your project folder `~/work/...`
      * Run (note the quotes and replace with your information) the following in the terminal:
```
git config credential.helper cache

git config user.email "first_last@skc.edu"
git config --local --list
```
  * Create a new "R Markdown" file

      * Optionally set "Knit on Save" - (runs entire notebook)
    * Verify output

## Save your work (with Git)

  * **Make sure all files are saved!**
    * Unsaved files will have a star at the end of the file name in the tab
  * Access the  *Git menu*
    * Use "Tools" -> "Version Control"; 
    * or the "GIT" dropdown in the main RStudio toolbar.
  * Select "Commit" in the *Git menu*: 
    * **Verify the work you have done**
      * Click the name of each file and see the changes
    * Check for unwanted files (secrets)!

        * Right click `R-Ecology.html` and select ignore
          * (optionally) change to `*.html`
        * Click "Save"
    * Add files (stage):
      * Click the "Staged" box to add them

      * Note: Commits should be "one" thing.
      * Title (no period)
        * Be descriptive on what you did - not "update"
        * less than 50 characters
        * Example: "Create a new RStudio project"
      * Blank line then a description, 
        * wrap at 72 characters (optional).
      * Blank line followed by a list (optional)
        * List starts with a '-' character (no space)
      * Press "Commit" and "Close"
    * "Push" to repository (top right of Git window):
      * Enter the username and password for the Git repo (not your account)
      * Make sure there is not an error
    * Verify push
      * Click "Push" again and make sure it says "Everyting up-to-date"
      * Close git window

  * Start RStudio: 
    * In the Launcher (should be open, otherwise open with "File" -> "New Launcher") 
    * Click "RStudio" (under "Notebook" section)
  * Open Project: "File" -> "Open Project" -> navigate to `work/project-name/project-name.Rproj` and click open
  * Git Pull: "Tools" -> "Version Control" -> "Pull Branches"
    * Enter git user and password
    * Watch for errors
  * Verify Pull:
    * "Pull" again and it should say "Already up to date."
    
## Carpentry Workshop Lesson Notes

  * For installing external libraries you can install them via RStudio after they have been referenced in a R Markdown file with a `library(ratdat)`.
    * Note: The file must be saved before the option to install is shown.
    * Note: The R session must be restarted. Do this with
      * "Session" -> "Restart R"
  * Libraries can also be installed with a `Setup.Rmd` file.
    * `Setup.Rmd` must be run once every time you start a new environment (start a Juypter Lab instance) (this can be different on other systems). 
    * See [Setup.Rmd](prep/Setup.Rmd) for an example.
  * Do not include `install.packages()` in your R Markdown files (other than `Setup.Rmd) as the R Markdown file is run every time it is displayed with "Knit" and will re-install the packages every time.


## Technical Notes

### RStudio keyboard shortcuts

  * cmd-r/ctrl-r - Run a line and move to the next
  * option-r/alt-r - Run a single line and stay on that line

### Git Configuration

For password based projects, configure username, email address, and enable password saving for your new project. Run in terminal once after the project has been created. Note the use of double quotes.

```bash
git config credential.helper cache
git config user.name "First Last"
git config user.email "first_last@skc.edu"
git config --local --list
```
*Please note we do not use `--global` since no global settings are saved in this Environment.

For personal access token projects, configure a persistent git configuration.  Use this code in a `setup.sh` bash script or bash notebook that you must run once after logging in and launching a new envrionment.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
ln -sfv ~/work/.gitconfig ~/
ln -sfv ~/work/.git-credentials ~/

git config --global credential.helper store
git config --global --list
```

You can also setup your `user.name` and `user.email` for every project (that is what `--global` does). This only needs to be once.  Replace the name and email  with your information and note the use of double quotes.  

```bash
git config --global user.name "First Last"
git config --global user.email "first_last@skc.edu"
```

### Git Status

Check the status of your project with the remote repository.  In a terminal run:
```bash
git fetch
git status
```

### R Configuration

R packages must be installed every time the environment is started, to do this a `setup.R` script or a R Markdown document must be run with the following:

```r
options(repos = list(CRAN="http://cran.rstudio.com/"))
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "ratdat"))
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

If you want to run this script from your setup.sh you can add code:
```bash
Rscript setup.R
```
